The [Wikipedia](https://kafka.apache.org/) site describes Redis as an:

> in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, hyperloglogs, bitmaps, streams and spatial indexes.

Before you can use Redis for your applications, you need to deploy a Redis server cluster.

In this workshop, you will learn how to create a Redis cluster using the Redis operator.
